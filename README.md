# ls

I was distracted in a coffee shop by conversation inbetween downloading a particular version of go. I had typed out the command `cp go /usr/bin/` without paying attention to what was already typed. I instinctively typed in `ls` when I looked back at my computer and hit enter. It took a second to let it sink in that I had just replaced `ls` with a go compiler. Yay! Instead of reinstalling core utils I decided to make my own `ls` with the compiler I had ust replaced it with!
