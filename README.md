# ls

I was distracted in a coffee shop by conversation inbetween downloading particular version of go and had typed out the command `cp go /usr/bin/`. Without paying attention to what was already typed, I instinctively typed in `ls` and hit enter, which now replaced ls with a go compiler. Yay! Instead of reinstalling core utils I just decided to make my own ls with the compiler I just replaced it with!
